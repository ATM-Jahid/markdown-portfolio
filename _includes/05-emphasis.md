Ufff, this is *tough*! I am here to learn *github and __markdown__*. Now, it has turned into a **writing** course! :pensive:

I like *C++, Haskell and Python*. However, my proficiency in those is not something to boast about. :persevere: The situation might change soon!

Speaking of **skills**... Nah! It's weird to talk to about it. :no_mouth:
